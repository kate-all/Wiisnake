# Wiisnake

[![Demo:](http://img.youtube.com/vi/y7_D-ff5lWo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7_D-ff5lWo "Demo")

The classic game of snake, played with a wii remote and a raspberry pi! 

Game controls:
Play by turning your wii remote(s) sideways and using the control pad to move the head of the snake. 

Game rules:
Eat as many food items as you can! Each food eaten causes the snake to grow and the game to speed up. 
You lose if you touch your own tail or the edge of the screen. In multiplayer mode, you can also lose
by colliding with your opponent's tail. Player 1 is the red snake, and player 2 is the green snake.

Download rules: Clone this repository onto your raspberry pi (I am using a model 4). Then simply open the folder and run the snake.py player on your raspberry pi (I am using a model 4)! Make sure you have at least one wii remote.

Enjoy!
